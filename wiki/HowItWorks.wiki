= How Appstart works =

At the core of Appstart, a child process is spawned after the launch of the Appstart jar file. Basically, everything boils down to: 
{{{
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(<java process with parameters>);
}}}
of course, there is more that that:
 * The position of the "java" launcher is taken from the system property ${java.home}. So, the JRE used to run start.jar is also used to run the child process.
 * The folder in which resides the start.jar file is called the "Application folder"
 * A file named appstart.properties inside the application folder is read. Inside it there must be the reference to the main class to launch and eventual JVM options to use.
 * If there is a subfolder called "lib", every folder and jar file in it will be added to the classpath. You can configure the position of the lib folder in the appstart.properties
 * If a file called "splash.img" is found in the application folder, it is used as a splash screen of the child java process. This feature requires the use of Java 6.

The command line used by Appstart is this:
{{{
${java.home}/bin/java <vm-options> -cp <class-path> -splash:<splashfile> <main-class>
}}}
